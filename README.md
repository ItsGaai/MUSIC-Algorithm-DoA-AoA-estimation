# MUSIC-Algorithm-DoA-AoA-estimation

Using MUSIC algorithm to estimate DoA or AoA.

MUSIC1.m: Using steering vector to simulate receiving data and estimate DoA/AoA.

data1.txt: Data that has been received.

MusicData1.m: Using data1.txt and MUSIC algorithm to estimate DoA/AoA. In this code, there is no need to use steering vector to simulate receiving data, because in practice, the steering vector is an attribute of the antenna array itself.
